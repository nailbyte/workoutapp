/*   
  A Brief Overview of CSS Units:
px (Pixel): A fixed-size unit that corresponds to literal screen pixels.
            It's consistent but doesn't scale based on user settings or parent element sizes.

em:     A relative unit of measurement that is based on the font-size of the element's parent
         or the element itself. For instance, if a parent element has a font-size of 20px, then 1em for a child element would be 20px.

rem (Root em): Similar to em, but always relative to the root element (<html>), 
                making it more predictable than em in complex layouts.

% (Percentage): A relative unit based on the parent element's size. 
                It's mainly used for widths and heights but can be used with other properties too.

vw/vh (Viewport Width/Viewport Height): Relative to the size of the viewport. 
                                        1vw is 1% of the viewport's width, and 1vh is 1% of the viewport's height.

pt (Point): Often used in print media, not recommended for screen displays. 
            1pt is equal to 1/72 of an inch.

When designing responsively, it's common to use a combination of these units to achieve the desired effect.
 It's often a good practice to use rem for padding, margins,
  and font sizes to ensure consistency and scalability across different devices and user settings.

  /* 
One Value: e.g., padding: 10px;
All four sides (top, right, bottom, left) will have a padding of 10px.

Two Values: e.g., padding: 10px 20px;
    Vertical (top and bottom) padding is 10px.
    Horizontal (right and left) padding is 20px.


Three Values: e.g., padding: 10px 20px 30px;
    Top padding is 10px.
    Right and left padding are 20px.
    Bottom padding is 30px.

Four Values: e.g., padding: 10px 20px 30px 40px;
    Top padding is 10px.
    Right padding is 20px.
    Bottom padding is 30px.
    Left padding is 40px.

    The same rules apply to the margin property.

/* <Typography style={{ display: 'inline-block' }}>Set 1:{" "}</Typography>
<TextField className="compact-input" style={{ display: 'inline-block', verticalAlign: 'middle' }} /> kg X{" "}

A few things to note:

display: 'inline-block' makes the elements appear inline.
verticalAlign: 'middle' is added to the <TextField> to vertically center it relative to the adjacent text, as TextField components usually have some height to them. */
